# DANCE: A Deep Learning Library for Single-Cell Analysis
DANCE is a python toolkit to support deep learning models for analysing single-cell gene expression at scale. It includes three modules at present:
1. **Single-modality analysis**
2. **Single-cell multimodal omics**
3. **Spatially resolved transcriptomics**

Our goal is to build up a deep learning community for single cell analysis and provide GNN based architecture for users for further development in single cell analysis.
